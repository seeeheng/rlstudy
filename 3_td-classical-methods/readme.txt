This folder explores classical TD methods. Current implementations revolve around OpenAI's taxi.

1. TD(0), or Sarsa
2. Sarsamax
3. Q-learning (off-policy version of TD(0))
4. TD(lambda) (least number of episodes, but computationally expensive)

The graphs can be seen in "training-graphs", and weights of trained agents can be found in "agents".
